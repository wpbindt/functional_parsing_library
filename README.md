# functional_parsing_library

A small production non-ready Python library implementing basic applicative parsers. Roughly speaking, these are functions
with signature `str -> T | CouldNotParse` transforming strings into structured data. For example, you might have a function
`integer` which will transform `"1"` and `"-1919"` to the integers `1` and `-1919`, and the string `"boink"` to `CouldNotParse()`.

What makes these functions useful is that they can be combined with so-called parser combinators. This way, complicated parsers
can be gradually built up from smaller, simpler parsers. 
For example, if we already have parsers `nonnegative_integer` and `negative_integer`, the `integer` parser from earlier 
could be written as `integer = nonnegative_integer | negative_integer`, where `|` should be read as "or". This library 
implements various such combinators, such as `many`, `some`, `ignore_left`, `many_till`, and so on.

Another piece of structure that makes these functions useful is that they're functorial: If I have a parser `p` of type 
`Parser[T]` (that is, a function which parses strings to objects of type `T`), and a function `f: T -> S`, then `f * p`
will be a parser for objects of type `S`. For example, take `len * many(word('borf'))`, and try to parse `"borfborfborf"`.
Here `word('borf')` will parse `"borf"` to the string `"borf"` (and any other string to `CouldNotParse`), so the parser
`many(word('borf')` will try and match as many `"borf"`s as possible and parse our string to the list `['borf', 'borf', 'borf']`. 
The length of this list is 3, so `len * many(word('borf'))` parses our string to the integer 3.

This works with multi-argument functions as well. If `f` is a function of type `[T, S] -> U`, and we have parsers `p`
and `q` for objects of type `T` and `S`, then `f * p & q` will first try to match `p`, and if this succeeds it will try
and match `q`, and finally it will apply `f`.

Another feature of this library is its type safety. Running mypy on

```python
from functional_parsing_library.strings import word


def add_strings(one: str, two: str, three: str) -> int:
    return len(one + two + three)


reveal_type(add_strings * word('hi'))
reveal_type(add_strings * word('hi') & word('hi'))
reveal_type(add_strings * word('hi') & word('hi') & word('di'))
```
will show that the first parser has type `MappedParser[int, str, str]`, the second `MappedParser[int, str]`, and the
third `Parser[int]`. Expressions like
```python
add_strings * word('hi') & word('hi') & integer
```
or
```python
add_strings * word('hi') & word('hi') & word('hi') & word('hi')
```
will raise a `TypeError`, and mypy will catch this.

### TODO list
- Backport to earlier Python versions, say 3.9 and up.
- Ambiguity in parsing, for example `char('a') | word('ab')` should parse `"ab"` as both `"a"` with remainder `"b"` and as `"ab"` with no remainder.
- Endow the parsers with a monadic structure. Probably context managers can be used to craft some makeshift Haskell-like `do` notation.
- The failing tests in the `todos` module.
- if `p` is a parser for some unbound typevar `U`, and `f` a function from `U` to `Any`, mypy does not deal well 
  with the expression `f * p`.


### Internal mypy error
The following snippet results in an internal mypy error:
```python
from functional_parsing_library.combinators.maybe import maybe
from functional_parsing_library.integer.integer import integer


def transform_none(integer: int, *maybe_int: int | None) -> int:
    if maybe_int[0] is None:
        return 0
    return maybe_int[0] + integer


transform_none * integer & maybe(integer) & maybe(integer)
```
